# MiniKanban

My first project made in Elm lang.

[MiniKanban](https://burzomir.github.io/MiniKanban/)

Due to some issues with parcel bundler there are two build scripts. To make a build run:

1. `npm run build-github-pages`
2. After it is finished hit `ctrl + c`
3. Run `npm run fix-github-pages-build`
